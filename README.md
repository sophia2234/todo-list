# To Do List
Created for the purpose of teaching React to an Advanced JavaScript class at DMACC.

## Getting Started
1. In the terminal, go to the directory that you have cloned this repo in. Make sure you are in the same level that you see the `package.json`
2. If this is your first time running the app, run the command `yarn install` in your terminal.
3. Once your dependencies are installed, run the command `yarn start` to see the app.

Your todo list should open in your default browser!

Any changes you make to the app will automatically refresh the page and surface.

## HTML, CSS, JQuery Example
A simpler copy of this React project can be found in the directory `oldSchool`. 
The functionality and styling is not exactly identical, but it should be a good place to start 
drawing comparisons between how you would implement something in plain HTML and JavaScript vs. 
implementing something with React.

## Quick notes about this app
* `index.js` and `index.html` are the entry points of your app
* `ToDoList.js` is the equivalent of `App.js` when you create a brand new React app with `yarn create react-app`
* `ListItem.js`has examples of all the new syntax we learned in class (arrow functions, destructuring, 
ternary operators, etc).  It is probably the most complicated file in this project. If you can figure 
out what's going on in there, you can learn React!
